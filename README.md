Design a dataset for patients for the use of clinical trials on lung cancer immunotherapeutic drugs from a real EHR, for this example it was used MIMIC III. Within this dataset,  will include cancer patients within a certain age both genders, all ethnicities, all insurance types, and all ICD-9 diagnosis codes that include variations of commonly assigned lung cancer (162.0, 162.2, 162.3, 162.4, 162.5, 162.8, 162.9, 197.0, 231.2, 23.57, 239.1)We will also include exclusions on comorbidities with Addison’s Disease, Thyroiditis, or HIV-AIDS as a measure to exclude uncontrolled responses to new immunotherapies. Furthermore, we will exclude patients that have undergone radiotherapeutic treatments. In addition to this, we took into account laboratory measures with regards to ‘Bicarbonate’, ‘Red Blood Cells’, ‘White Blood Cells’, ‘Platelet Count’, ‘Oxygen Saturation’,‘pH’) or LOINC codes 1963-8, 789-8, 804-5, 777-3, 20564-1,
